Temperature
Have you ever pondered why your character can simply breeze through sub-zero water like nothing? Great question, this mod fixes that by adding an entirely new semi-realistic temperature system to the game.

Content:

32 brand new temperature related afflictions:
Frostbite, hypothermia and hyperthermia, heated diving suits and more! Enough content to provide a new experience for both medics and regular crew goers.

Focus on gameplay:
Have you ever played an NT addon and thought it was over the top and halted gameplay? Well fear not, for this mod doesn't care about being "realistic", it cares about being fun. Temperature itself only becomes truly fatal in extremely low or high amounts, otherwise it remains an annoyance at worst. Don't like it, then tweak it in the config! This mod is highly customizable for whatever experience you wish.

Light overhaul of gameplay:
Due to the addition of temperature, pressure isn't the only fear of water anymore, water and fire now cause issues if ignored. As a result of this, all crewmembers will approach the game in a new way, rather than then simply laughing away massive hull breaches or pits of fire, the crew must appropiately plan and navigate around it.

Why is this only a NT addon?
Simply put, I find NT to be the perfect canidate for a mod as this. Due to the already well thought out and maintained nature of Neurotrauma, adding this was extremely easy to do. I do not plan on ever making this a standalone mod, however, feel more then welcome to do so!

A Trello guide can be found Here![trello.com]
The trello also features a bunch of info regarding compatibility and other stuff. I also spent two whole days suffering while making it. Please read.

Compatibility/Requirements:
Requires Server Side Lua and NT to work.

This mod goes directly above Neurotrauma.

Compatibility with other NT addons/Mods:
NT Cybernetics has built in compatibility. Load order doesn't matter.
S.A.F.S has built in compatibility. Load order doesn't matter.
Immersive Diving Gear has built in compatibility. Goes above this mod.
All other NT addons should work just fine.
IMPORTANT!
Real sonar or any other mod that overrides/adds diving suits will most likely not feature internal heaters. However, I have thought about this and have three methods of compatibility.
1. Internal suit heaters provided by patches or built in.
2. External suit heaters which go on the belt/bag slot (Called 'E.S.H' in game).
3. Suit compatibilitiy mode which makes all suits heated by default (In config!).

Future Updates/Patches:
Due to the fact I made this addon because my ram died on my new computer, making me unable to work on my game,
this mod will not be updated often. I just recently got my ram back a few weeks ago. However I will fix any game breaking bugs, issues if I deem really important and make patches for other requested mods. I will only update the mod if I find freetime.
That being said I would like to add more content.

You do not have to ask me to fork, make a translation or edit this mod.
Feel free to make any contributions if you like!

Patches:
WARNING: Do not use any of the following patches if you are using Immersive Diving Gear and the same patch you are about to use below.
I.E: Using Immersive Diving Gear with the Real Sonar patch, no need to use the Real Sonar NT Thermal patch, it will have prebuilt compatibility!
Real Sonar Patch
I plan on EK next.
