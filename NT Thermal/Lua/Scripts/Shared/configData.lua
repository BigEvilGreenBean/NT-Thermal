-- The base of this code has been lifted from NT Eyes.

-- The default normal body temp is 37c, however due to the fact I can't have an affliction be at 0 (If I can let me know.), I offset all temp related values by 1. So normal body temp is now 38 and so on so forth.
-- Another note, Added 'New' prefix since it was bugged when I didn't, I'm not too sure why that was the case.
